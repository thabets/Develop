# Weekly Challenege 1
For this project we administered multiple changes to the code for better optimization as well as future workflow. As mentioned what was updated on the code is as follows:

    1. We have added sematic HTML elements to clarify the different sections of the code
    2. We Added structural elements and text markups to clearly define the workflow as well as what each element group represented
    3. We have reorganized and corrected any required changes to css code to fall in line with the the sematic HTML elements
    4. Removed any unnecessary code from the code base
    5. Organized structural elements and styling to follow a logical flow
    6. Added accessible alt attributes for images
    7. Made sure all heading attributes fall in order
    8. Defined a clear title

You should find that the code has been cleared, modified, tagged and organized for a quicker understanding of each section for any future needed modification
